Heat transfer: relation between mass, time and energy.

\vspace{1cm}
Heating a mass of water of 1 kg from 20°C to 30°C demands $1/2$ less energy than would 
a mass of 2 kg from 20°C to 30°C ; and $1/2$ less energy than needed to raise 1 kg from 20°C to 40°C. \\
We observe a double proportionality between energy, mass, \& the difference in temperature $\Delta$T.

$$Q=Cm\Delta T$$
$$Q\ heat = C\ [J/kg/\degree C] * m\ [kg] * \Delta T\ [\degree C]$$

$C$ is the coefficient of heat capacity. It's the quantity of heat needed to raise one kg of matter by 1\degree C.
If the value of $C$ is high, the material will need more energy to be heated. A high $C$ characterizes a high
resistance to temperature change. (thermal inertia) \\
To cool down 1 kg of water by 1\degree C, you have to substract C.
